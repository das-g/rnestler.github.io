Starting to blog again

:summary: Why I want to start blogging again

My `last post`_ on this blog is from 2017 when I was traveling around Europe to
visit different hackerspaces. I have fond memories of that time and still
regret not finishing the post about visiting `LJUDMILA`_ in Sarajevo. I also
regret that I immediately stopped writing blog posts after that and never wrote
a summary of my "Tour de Hackerspace".

The `drafts`_ of these `posts`_ lingering around in the git repository serve as a
reminder of this tragedy ðŸ˜‰.

A new beginning
---------------

Anyway: A lot has changed since then and beginning this year I started a new
job at `Renuo`_. Previously I was working at `Sensirion`_ for 8 years, where I
was doing various kind of software development, ranging from embedded C++,
developing a sensor evaluation desktop software in Python, creating a
demonstrator prototype in Rust for an automotive PM2.5 sensor to developing
infrastructure on Azure to power remote running long term studies of various
sensors.

So switching to a software agency that almost exclusively does Web development
with Ruby on Rails is quite a big change for me. Especially since I never
really worked with Ruby or Rails before.

Since I find my expedition into this new terrain quite exciting, I want to
share my experience of learning Ruby on this blog!
