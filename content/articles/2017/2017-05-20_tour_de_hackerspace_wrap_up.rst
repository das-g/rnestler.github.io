:summary: My retrospective regarding my tour de hackerspace


* Trip Planing / Organizing
  * Contact early, contact often, try to use instant messaging.
  * Be spontanious regarding places to sleep
  * Take your passport with you ;)

* Good Patterns
   * Cooking / eating together -> Family-feeling
   * Workshops
   * Split leadership, avoid single responsible persons
   * Rules to keep space clean
     * 3 Boxes -> in the last box stuff will get thrown away
   * Access to the space: Keys suck. Roll your own!
   * You may start like this:
     * Meetup
     * No formal organization -> Keep it private
     * When more then 10 members -> Make it a formal oranization
   * Communication
     * Public
     * Have at least an email address where people can contact the space
     * IRC is great for visitors because its easy and doesn't require a special user acount
     * Private
     * IF IRC is not actively used bridge it to some other medium (bots)
