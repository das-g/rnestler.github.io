:summary: Visiting Hackerspace Kraków

Since the 3G connection during the train ride was exceptionally bad, I had
trouble with my credit card and the train didn't have electric plugs, I ran out
of battery before I could finish booking a hotel.

So the first thing I did when arriving in Kraków was looking for the
`Hackerspace Kraków`_.  Luckily it's very close to the main train station and
Wiktor, one of the members which talked to me on IRC, was waiting outside to
show me in!  This made me feel very welcome!

    Entry to the `Hackerspace Kraków`_

After charging my devices, talking to my credit card company and booking my
hotel, he showed me around.  They've actually just moved in a few month ago and
the space isn't yet open for public, so they told me.  They are still thinking
about ideas on how to decorate the space.  I proposed to make the entry look
like a submarine since the corridor is very narrow and rounded on the top.  I'm
looking forward to see what they will do with the space.

The space mainly consist of:

* An `electronic lab`_
* A `computer / presentation room`_
* A `workshop room`_

In the workshop they actually built the ventilation system themself!

And during my visit they actually built a controller board to be able to
regulate the speed of the ventilation system.  Was awesome to watch them
getting busy until 1 or 2am.

They also told me about some past and present projects.  In the past they
helped build the lightening system for the Galeria Krakowska, which is a big
shopping mall close to the main train station.

The green LED wall on the picture can actually change color and also show
different animations and effects.

Another project they are working on is tracking and collecting "radio sondes"
form the TODO project. This probes are used for weather related analysis.
