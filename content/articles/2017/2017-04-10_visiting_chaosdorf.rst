:summary: Visiting the chaosdorf

While my original "plan" involved traveling directly to Amsterdam from
Stuttgart, the shackspace guys suggested to visit chaosdorf in Düsseldorf,
since it is halfway to Amsterdam anyway.

After asking if anybody will be present on their IRC channel #chaosdorf, I
decided to stay two days in Düsseldorf.

Chaosdorf is awesomely close to the Düsseldorf main station! Also quite close
is the Hostel A&O where I could stay.
