:summary: Visiting the `Plan Zero`_ hackerspace

After a quite relaxing train ride, I arrived in Timișoara at 21:30.  After
contacting the hackerspace via email, Mihai, a member of the space, suggested
that he can pick me up from the train station and I can spend the night in the
hackerspace.  After some difficulties finding each other at the train station
we went directly to the space.

He then gave me a short tour around the space, especially showing me their (or
mainly his) awesome collection of fully working retro computers.

Amongst others they own a C-64, an Amiga, Apple-II clones and a `Mac Classic`_.
After the quick show around he just handed me the keys for the space, showed me
the couch and explained me which doors I need to close over night.  I was
impressed by this level of trust they showed me!

So after hacking a *tiny bit* on the C-64 while getting constant attention from
the cat which lives in the space, I went to sleep around 3 in the morning.

The next day I explored the city and met with Mihai in the afternoon.  We then
took a quick look at the art atelier where his wife works.  After that we
returned to the hackerspace.

Like almost every hackerspace Plan Zero also has a main room.  In contrast to
other spaces the main room is more about hanging out and eating than working.

Next there is a room with electronics equipment 3D printers and work places.

While three 3D printers are fully operational, one of the members is building a
forth printer next to them.

The space is also well equipped for most mechanic needs, with a nice workshop.

Also similar to other spaces there is a small storage room for random stuff.

After I spent some time taking a closer look at the space, taking pictures and
talking to the members, we ordered the classic hackers dinner (pizza).  Although
spending the night at the hackerspace was nice, it didn't have a shower, so I
booked a hostel nearby.  Despite their website saying one can check in until
23:00, when we arrived there, nobody was present.  Luckily Claudiu and Andrei
helped me contacting the owner of the hostel so he could let me in.

When everything related to the hostel was resolved, they showed me some of the
cooler bars in Timișoara, where we had some beer, live music and a fun time
together!  What I learned that night was, that the Romanians party a bit harder
then what I can handle, so I was glad when we ordered a taxi together to get
back to my hostel at 5am ;)

After sleeping in and having some late breakfast I returned to the hackerspace.

Mihai was also at the space and tried to hook up an Amiga with a floppy
emulator which allows to connect USB thumb drives with images on it.  After
trying several USB drives and bricking one due to wrong wiring, he finally got
it working:

When planning for my next destination I realized that traveling through the
Balkan area by train is harder than I thought.  Apparently the direct line from
Timișoara to Belgrade got canceled some time ago (But was still present on the
InterRail map).  So I tried to find a ride on BlaBlaCar which worked, but then
the ride got cancelled some hours before the start because the driver had
problems with his car.  So in order to get to Belgrade I needed to take an 18h
train ride via Budapest.  Well, this at least gave me some time to write this
blog post ;)
