:summary: Visiting Sarajevo

My BlaBlaCar ride [#]_ to Sarajevo was a very pleasant experience.  My driver
was really nice, we talked a lot, and he explained my the different places
while we were passing by.  I loved the experience of entering Bosnia when
suddenly the whole landscape looks different, with lots of hills and forests.

We then arrived in the early afternoon in Sarajevo.  Quite early during my
"Tour de Hackerspace" `Czesiek`_ offered `via Twitter`_ to show me around
Sarajevo when I get there for a visit, which I found quite amazing!  So I
arranged with him to couch surf at his place and meet him there in the evening.

Since I had the whole afternoon to explore the city I decided to store my
luggage in a nearby hostel and wander around the old town of the city.  I had
some of the `Bosnian coffee`_ and tried the Ćevapi for late lunch.

At some point during the afternoon I noticed, that I forgot my Ferris plushie
in the BlaBlaCar!  So I contacted the driver again and we arranged to meet the
next day in the morning.

In the evening I met with Czesiek and after placing my luggage in his flat, we
proceeded to go to a micro brewery to get some of the local beer.  Afterwards
we went to a few other places and at one place ended up meeting some Australian
guys I've seen earlier in the afternoon in the old town.  I always love meeting
other people who are travelling because they are most of the time easy going
and have some interesting stories to tell.

We ended up having lots of fun this night which lead to me having a very hard
time getting up at 8:00 to retrieve my Ferris.  But it amazed me how when
meeting other hackers during my trip I feel connected to them instantly like we
were knowing each others for years.

Since the weather was just too nice, I spent the next day visiting the `Bijela
tabija castle`_ where one has a nice view over the city.  During my way up I
also enjoyed exploring this part of the city which consist of many small
streets and alleyways.

In the evening we had again lots of fun, this time visiting a sisha bar /
hookah lounge where there was some live music.  In the mean time I found out,
that the hackerspace which is mentioned in the hackerspace wiki probably
doesn't exist.  So during the evening I talked with Czesiek and his friends
about founding one in Sarajevo.

The next day I slept in and then met with Czesiek for lunch and then proceeded
to visit his workplace in Sarajevo.  He works for the `Organized Crime And
Corruption Reporting Project`_ (OCCRP), which does a great job supporting
investigative journalism all over the world.

Since I wanted to avoid taking pictures of any sensitive material I just took a
picture of the door to the office ;)

TODO more information about OCCRP!

I then proceeded to verify that the hackerspace really doesn't exist.  When
arriving at the place it's supposed to be I found an interesting technology hub
called `HUB387`_.  Nobody there heard about a hackerspace there, so I changed
the wiki entry to reflect that.  Because I was already there, I rented a desk
at the `NEST71`_ coworking space for 10€ and spent some time working on this
blog post.

In the evening there was a party at Czesieks house and I had the pleasure to
meet more of the OCCRP crew and other interesting people.  I enjoyed the fact,
that we consisted of people from 7 different nations (Polish, French, Bosnian,
Mexican, American, British and Swiss)!

After having some slight trouble getting up on Saturday morning, I attended a
protest against violence against LGBT people.  It was a very peaceful and
somewhat cheerful event.  After that we went for some coffee and I had the
opportunity to meet interesting people including a German guy who works for the
European embassy.

In the afternoon I visited the `War Childhood Museum`_.  It was a very heart
touching experience of reading the stories of how children were experiencing
the war.
