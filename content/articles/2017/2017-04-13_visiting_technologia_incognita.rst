:summary: Visiting Technologia Incognita

Getting a place to stay in Amsterdam was harder then I thought due to the fact,
that a lot of hotels and hostels where fully or almost fully booked!  I still
got a room after a bit of hassle (I accidentally booked "1 bed in the women
sleeping room", silly me) in the "WOW Amsterdam" hostel. It's not that close to
the center, but reachable with either bus or the metro.

After the train ride from DÃ¼sseldorf, a bus ride to my hostel I took the metro
to `Technologia Incognita`_.

The space features the usual stuff with a kitchen, a `laser-cutter`_, a work
shop and of course some `awesome decoration`_!

I had the luck to arrive when they had their visiting day, so lots of people
where around.  Also sine the next day was the `Hack in the Box`_ conference
some attendees of this conference where there as well.  I even met some guys
from the `NYC Resistor`_ which invited me to have a look at their hackerspace
next time I'm in New York (which will be around June).  They told me about a
project where they create almost impossible to solve `puzzles`_.

I also met `Saskia Freeke`_ who creates amazing digital art!

There was also a cheese tasting this day which I, as a Swiss guy, definitely
approve!
