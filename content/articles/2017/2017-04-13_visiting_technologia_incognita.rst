:summary: Visiting Technologia Incognita

Getting a place to stay in Amsterdam was harder then I thought due to the fact,
that a lot of hotels and hostels where fully or almost fully booked!  I still
got a room after a bit of hassle (Thanks to this booking sites "only two rooms
left, book them now!", I accidentally booked "1 bed in the women sleeping
room", silly me) in the "WOW Amsterdam" hostel. It's not that close to the
center, but reachable with either bus or the metro.

After the train ride from DÃ¼sseldorf, a bus ride to my hostel I took the metro
to `Technologia Incognita`_.

The space features the usual stuff with a kitchen, a `laser-cutter`_ (if you
look closely you will see the sell the Diplomatic Passport in their vending
machine on the left), a work shop and of course some `awesome decoration`_!

I had the luck to arrive when they had their visiting day, so lots of people
where around.  Also sine the next day was the `Hack in the Box`_ conference
some attendees of this conference where there as well.  I even met some guys
from the `NYC Resistor`_ which invited me to have a look at their hackerspace
next time I'm in New York (which will be around June).  They told me about a
project where they create almost impossible to solve `puzzles`_.

I also met `Saskia Freeke`_ who creates amazing digital art!

She has a project where she creates similar work every single day since 2015!

There was also a cheese, sausage and beer tasting on the same evening which I,
as a Swiss guy, definitely approve!

The next day I spontaneously attended the `Hack in the Box`_ conference where
hackerspaces from the Netherlands also had booths.  I really enjoyed `Toools`_
lock-picking booth and the talk of Jos Weyers `Most Impressive: A Guide to Key
Impressioning Attacks`

While I really enjoyed my stay in Amsterdam and with `Technologia Incognita`_
and almost replanned my trip to spend a few more days there, I decided to stick
with my plan for once and travel to Warsaw via Berlin, with a short stop to
visit c-base.
