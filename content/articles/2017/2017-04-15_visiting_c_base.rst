:summary: Visiting c-base

After an exhausting train ride from Amsterdam to Berlin which started at 20.25
and ended at 5.33 the next day, I discovered that I couldn't get a train the
same day to Warsaw since they were all fully booked!

So my plans changed a bit and I would stay a full day in Berlin which was nice
in some way because it meant I could visit `c-base`_ in the evening!

Also I discovered by coincidence that a few friends of mine from Switzerland
were staying in Berlin this weekend and I could hang out with them during the
day.  I also met with `@andrewhobden`_ in Berlin, whom I met at `RustFest
2016`_ last year.  This was a very awesome coincidence, since we didn't plan
any of it and we just ended up meeting in Berlin and having a great time
together!

So after dinner we split again and I headed towards c-base.  c-base is located
near the "Jannowitzbr√ºcke" and thus very easily reachable with public
transport.

When entering c-base I was amazed because of all the very nicely done
decoration they have inside which leads to a great atmosphere!

The members in the space were a bit busy because they had their "circle"
meeting.
