:summary: Visiting the Hackerspace Szeged

After returning from RustFest I spent one more day in Budapest to pick up my
luggage from the Hackerspace Budapest and to recover a bit from the lack of
sleep during my visit in Kiev.

Since I had some trouble contacting the `Hackerspace Szeged`_ and I didn't
bother to book a hostel or anything, I just took the train to Szeged and hoped
for the best.  As it turns out once more, the advantage of not planing anything
at all is, that one can't get disappointed and is open to positive surprises!

This time I had the pleasure to meet Zsuzsa who studies in Budapast and lives
in Szeged.  Upon hearing about my trip, she spontaneously invited me to stay
with her and Balint in their apartment.  Sometimes it's hard to grasp for me
how incredibly lucky I am to meet all these amazing people during my travel!

So after sharing some pizza for dinner with them I tried to visit the
Hackerspace Szeged, since they told me they had a lock picking workshop this
evening.  Sadly I arrived to late at their space and their workshop was already
over and they left the space.  I guess this is one of the downsides of not
planing ;)

Anyway, I spent the next day taking a look at the wonderful city of Szeged,
including a visit to the `"Witch Island" area`_ and the local zoo.

In the evening I finally managed to pay a short visit to the Hackerspace
Szeged.  They had a follow up of their lock picking workshop of the day before,
so they explained me how to theoretically pick combination locks.

They are a young and rather small hackerspace, but active nevertheless!  The
space consist of the classical main room:

And a second smaller room which they mostly use as a storage room.

Since I already made plans to spend the rest of the evening with Zsuzsa and
Balint, I spent just about 2 hours in their space.  I'd loved to hear more
about the projects they are working on, so maybe I'll return in the future to
visit them again.

All in all I had an amazing stay in Szeged!  While I'd loved to stay a few more
days,  I was really looking forward to visit Timi≈üoara in Romania!
