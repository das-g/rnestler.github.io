:summary: Visiting Warsaw Hackerspace

I was warned on IRC that the activity would be rather low in the Warsaw
Hackerspace Due to beeing easter.  So when I arrived in Warsaw I just monitored
their `member tracking site`_ from time to time until it showed some people
beeing present.

On arrival they showed me arround their hackerspace. Of course they have a
laser-cutter [#]_ and some 3D printers.

What really impressed me was the equipment in their work shop! They have
amongst other stuff a CNC drill and lathe.  They control the CNC machines using
`linuxcnc`_.
