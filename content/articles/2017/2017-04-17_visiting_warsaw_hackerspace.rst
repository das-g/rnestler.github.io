:summary: Visiting Warsaw Hackerspace

I was warned on IRC that the activity would be rather low in the Warsaw
Hackerspace Due to being Easter.  So when I arrived in Warsaw I just monitored
their `member tracking site`_ from time to time until it showed some people
being present.

The entry to the space was a bit hard to find, because it's in the basement.
But they later told me, that they will move their space to a different location
next month anyway.

On arrival they showed me around their hackerspace.  Of course they have a
laser-cutter [#]_ and some 3D printers.

I was told, that hhe `Warsaw Hackerspace`_ has around 100 members consisting of
a good mix of computer science, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering
and other people.

What really impressed me was the equipment in their work shop! They have
amongst other stuff a CNC mill and `lathe`_.  They control the CNC machines using
`linuxcnc`_.

They also have equipment to produce their own PCBs, using a cheap UV nail
curing lamp.

They also have some pretty awesome ancient devices like their VT520 terminal
which they use to print the messages posted on IRC.

Later in the evening I had an awesome debugging session with one of their
members who tried to intercept C library calls (This was part of an university
assignment).  Since I never looked into how dynamic linking works in Linux,
this was very interesting for me!  Maybe I'll write a separate blog post about
that if I find time to dig a bit deeper into the topic.

.. [#] We should really get a laser-cutter for coredump. This will be the first thing I will do when I return!
