:summary: Visiting brmlab

After a quite pleasant night train ride I arrived around 7am in Prague.  This
left me with enough time to book my hotel and get to know the city a bit.

I booked the `A plus Hostel`_ close to the Florenc metro station which is in
the intersection of two metro lines, giving me a great starting point to
explore the city.

Since the `brmlab`_ website showed, that the space is apparently open, I
decided to take a look at it quite early in the day.  I had some trouble
actually finding the space, so I advice you to use their `well written
description`_ on how to find their space.

The space features some of the usual stuff:

* A big main working room

* A small server room

* A workshop

But what really sets their hackerspace apart from others is that it features a
chemistry and a bio lab!

We did actually take a look at a small silicon wafer from unknown origin the
same evening.

Inside the bio lab there is also the relax zone / silent room.

Quite stunning is their high voltage lab

It features some quite huge `Tesla coils`_ and other high voltage equipment such
as high voltage capacitors, transformers or high voltage measurement systems.

Also really impressive is the bitcoin ATM they have!

I couldn't resist and `bought myself 6 mBTC`_ immediately.  They told me that
this is the first prototype of the `General Bytes bitcoin ATM`_.  It was
installed in their space so they could test it.  During testing they found and
reported two security issues, which then could be fixed.

Like most hackerspaces they also have some awesome decorations, in this case a
wall paneled with motherboards.

The also own an `IBM AS/400 system`_ with a fitting hardware terminal which
gives one some possibilities to discover a mainframe style system.

It was real fun interacting with this machine!  You can find more information
about it on their `wiki`_.

All in all my Prague and brmlab experience was really amazing! The city is very
beautiful (albeit a bit crowed with tourists) and I enjoyed hanging out with a
few of the brmlab hackers the other night!
