:summary: Visiting brmlab

After a quite pleasant night train ride I arrived around 7am in Prague.  This
left me with enough time to book my hotel and get to know the city a bit.

I booked the `A plus Hostel`_ close to the Florenc metro station which is in
the intersection of two metro lines, giving me a great starting point to
explore the city.

Since the `brmlab`_ website showed, that the space is apparently open, I
decided to take a look at it quite early in the day.  I had some trouble
actually finding the space, so I advice you to use their `well written
description`_ on how to find their space.

The space features some of the usual stuff

* A big main working room
* An `electro lab`_
* A kitchen with their shop

What really sets their hackerspace apart from others is that it features a
chemistry and a bio lab!

We did actually take a look at a small silicon wafer from unknown origin the
same evening.

Also really impressive is the bitcoin ATM they have!

    Bitcoin ATM

I couldn't resist and `bought myself 6 mBTC`_ immediately.  They told me that
this is the first prototype of the `General Bytes bitcoin ATM`_.  It was
installed in their space so they could test it.  During testing they found and
reported two security issues, which then could be fixed.
