:summary: Visiting `hacklab01`_ in Zagreb

After an entertaining BlaBlaCar ride with a mixed group of 7 Croatians who did
enjoy a weekend of river rafting, I arrived in Zagreb at around 22:00.  I
agreed with Vedran from `hacklab01`_ to meet in front of the building.

During my email conversations with Vedran I kinda realized, that I'm not just
visiting a hackerspace, but an alternative culture centre called Medika [#]_
which is run by `AKC Attack`_.  So upon arrival I was quite enchanted by the
charm of the place.
