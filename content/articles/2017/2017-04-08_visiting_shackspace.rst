:summary: Visiting the shackspace

I arrived at Stuttgart at 5 pm.  During the trainsride I asked on the
#shackspace IRC channel if someboy could recommend a place to stay.  All they
told me was I should avoid the "Ambiente".  So I booked a hotel room close to
the shackspace which is 15 minutes from the main train station.

Soon after ariving at the hotel I went to the shackspace.

I had the luck that they were giving a tour to some visitors just when I
arrived, so I could join them.

Coming from the rather small hackerspace `coredump`_ from Switzerland,
shackspace is huge!

They have around 400mÂ² of room in their space, given them the possibility to have:

* A kitchen
* A big main working room
* A machine room with Lasercutter, 3D-Printer, ...
* A silent room, mainly used by student for learning
* A confrence room

Like every hackerspace they have lots of beautiful installations arround, like
a Back to the Future themed clock which also shows the founding date.

They also have a beautiful installation showing the open status of various
hackerspaces, gathered via the `SpaceAPI`_
