:summary: Visiting the shackspace

I arrived at Stuttgart at 5 pm.  During the train ride I asked on the
#shackspace IRC channel if somebody could recommend a place to stay.  All they
told me was I should avoid the "Ambiente".  So I booked a hotel room close to
the `shackspace`_ which is 15 minutes from the main train station.

Soon after arriving at the hotel I went to the shackspace.

I had the luck that they were giving a tour to some visitors just when I
arrived, so I could join them.

Coming from the rather small hackerspace `coredump`_ from Switzerland,
shackspace is huge!

They have around 400mÂ² of room in their space, given them the possibility to have:

* A kitchen
* A big main working room
* A machine room with `laser-cutter`_, 3D-printer, ...
* A `work shop`_ with drilling machines, saws etc.
* A silent room, mainly used by student for learning
* A `conference room`_
* `Amateur radio station`_ with `antennas`_ on the roof
* Around 200 members

Like every hackerspace they have lots of beautiful installations arround, like
a Back to the Future themed clock which also shows the founding date.

They also have a beautiful installation showing the open status of various
hackerspaces, gathered via the `SpaceAPI`_

Since a member of the space was preparing food for dinner, they invited me
spontaneously to join them! This was awesome, since it meant spending more time
hacking and less searching for food ;)

Later I joined the conference room, discussing ideas for the `Space Apps
Challenge 2017`_ for which the shakspace hosts a `hackathon`_.  Last year the
came up with a project to optimize the growth of plants with machine learning.

I really enjoyed my stay at shackspace! It's a great hackerspace with lots of
creative and technically gifted people hacking on awesome projects.
