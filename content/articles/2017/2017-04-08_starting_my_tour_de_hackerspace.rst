:summary: Starting my "Tour de Hackerspace"

Today I start what I call my "Tour de Hackerspace"! I'll be travelling around
Europe and visit various `hackerspaces`_ on the way.

Since I'm not the kind of person which is great at planing, this will be more
or less a spontaneous adventure.  I contacted some hackerspaces upfront and
received some great and welcoming responses, especially from the Eastern part
of Europe.

My first location will be the `shackerspace`_ in Stuttgart, Germany.  After that
I plan to visit a hackerspace in Amsterdam, then travelling a bit in the east
(Czech Republic, Poland, ...) and probably attend the `RustFest 2017`_ in Kyiv,
Ukraine.

According to my definitely not definitive plan I will then travel southwards
visiting Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia,
... before returning to Switzerland.

I'm really looking forward to meet lots of amazing people and see how they live
and hack around Europe!

I will try to write a blog post about every hackerspace I visit on my journey,
so stay tuned.
